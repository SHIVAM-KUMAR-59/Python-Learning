# Virtual Environment - A virtual environment in Python is an isolated environment that allows you to manage dependencies for a project without interfering with other projects on the same machine. It helps to keep dependencies required by different projects in separate places, avoiding conflicts between them. This is especially useful when working on multiple projects with different package requirements.

# 1. Creating a virtual environment - pip install virtualenv (Windows) or pip3 install virtualenv (Mac)
# 2. Using virtual environment - virtualenv <name of the environment>
# 3. Deactivating a virtual environment - deactivate 
# 4. Removing a virtual environment - rm -rf <name of the environment>

# pip freeze > requirements.txt (Windows) or pip3 freeze > requirements.txt - To create a requirements.txt file
