Each file focuses on specific concepts with practical examples, helping reinforce both foundational and advanced topics in Python for learners aiming to deepen their understanding of programming.
I will be following Code With Harry's [Python Course](https://youtu.be/UrsmFxEIp5k?si=mJSRMs7rEdKXKuUy) to learn and implement the concepts.

## Concepts Covered üìö

The repository includes examples of:

- Basic Syntax and Data Types
- Strings
- Lists and Tuples
- Sets and Dictionaries
- Conditional Expressions
- Loops
- Functions
- File I/O
